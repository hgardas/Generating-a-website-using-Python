### How to Run the code

2. Open **create_website.py** using Python.
	_This will create a HTML file called **fresh_tomatoes.html**_
3. Open **fresh_tomatoes.html**

The website created contains 9 of my favorite movies with name and box art. Clicking each one of them will open the trailer  
of that movie.
